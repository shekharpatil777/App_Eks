✅ WebSocket handshake → Connection establishment → Data transmission → Connection closure
Breakdown:
WebSocket handshake: Initiated by the client using an HTTP Upgrade request to switch the protocol to WebSocket.

Connection establishment: If the server accepts the upgrade, a WebSocket connection is established.

Data transmission: Full-duplex communication begins, allowing both client and server to send messages independently.

Connection closure: Either the client or server can initiate closing the connection when communication is done.

✔️ Final Answer:
WebSocket handshake, Connection establishment, Data transmission, Connection closure ✅
