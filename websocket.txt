✅ WebSocket handshake → Connection establishment → Data transmission → Connection closure
Breakdown:
WebSocket handshake: Initiated by the client using an HTTP Upgrade request to switch the protocol to WebSocket.

Connection establishment: If the server accepts the upgrade, a WebSocket connection is established.

Data transmission: Full-duplex communication begins, allowing both client and server to send messages independently.

Connection closure: Either the client or server can initiate closing the connection when communication is done.

✔️ Final Answer:
WebSocket handshake, Connection establishment, Data transmission, Connection closure ✅

When using webhooks, what happens during the connection establishment process?

The source system sends a POST request to the webhook URL.

The receiving server initiates the webhook handshake.

The webhook URL is created to store payload data.

The source system generates an authentication token for the webhook.

The correct answer is:

✅ The source system sends a POST request to the webhook URL.
Explanation:
When using webhooks, there is no persistent connection like with WebSockets. Instead, the workflow is event-driven:

The source system (e.g., Stripe, GitHub) detects an event.

It sends an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL configured by the receiving system.

This POST request contains the event payload (e.g., JSON data).

There is no traditional connection establishment or handshake step. The interaction is stateless and initiated by the source system.
